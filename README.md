# Ping Pong Game in JS

A simple ping pong game in JavaScript, with basic scoring system.

### Controls

The player can move his/her mouse up and down to move their paddle.

There is a 'reset'-button on the bottom-left to reset the game.

And there is a 'play / pause' button, to either play or pause the game. The player is still able to move the paddle, when the game is paused.


### Notes

It will be a little bit buggy, if you find any bugs, feel free to create an issue and create a PR.
